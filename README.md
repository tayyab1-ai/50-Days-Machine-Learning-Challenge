# 📘 Day 0 — Planning

## ✅ What I Did Today
- Created the complete **project and repository structure**
- Connected the project with **GitHub version control**
- Designed a clear **50-day learning roadmap**
- Set up the foundation for **daily documentation and progress tracking**
- Prepared the environment for starting Machine Learning practice

# 📘 Day 1 — Mastering NumPy Essentials

## ✅ What I Did Today
- **Deep Dive into NumPy:** Moved beyond basic usage to a structured, categorical exploration of the library.
- **Comprehensive Notebook Creation:** Built a dedicated `.ipynb` file documenting every major NumPy function with detailed parameter explanations.
- **Categorized Learning:** Organized the library into logical modules:
    * **Array Creation:** `np.array()`, `np.zeros()`, `np.ones()`, `np.linspace()`, and `np.arange()`.
    * **Array Manipulation:** Reshaping, flattening, stacking (hstack/vstack), and splitting.
    * **Mathematical Operations:** Element-wise operations, broadcasting, and universal functions (ufuncs).
    * **Statistical Analysis:** Finding mean, median, standard deviation, and variance.
    * **Indexing & Slicing:** Advanced slicing and boolean indexing for data filtering.
- **Hands-on Practice:** Tested various parameters (like `dtype`, `axis`, and `order`) to understand how NumPy handles memory and computation.

# 📘 Day 2 — Advanced NumPy: Random & Linear Algebra Modules

## ✅ What I Did Today
- **Advanced Array Operations:** Explored complex array manipulations and submodules that form the mathematical core of Machine Learning.
- **Mastering `numpy.random`:** * Implemented various distribution functions: `rand()`, `randn()`, `randint()`, and `choice()`.
    * Explored **Probability Distributions**: Detailed study of `normal()`, `uniform()`, and `binomial()` distributions with all their parameters (`loc`, `scale`, `size`).
    * Understood the importance of **Random Seeding** using `np.random.seed()` for reproducible results.
- **Deep Dive into `numpy.linalg` (Linear Algebra):**
    * **Matrix Operations:** Solved systems of linear equations using `np.linalg.solve()`.
    * **Matrix Decomposition:** Implemented **SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)** and **Matrix Factorization**.
    * **Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors:** Calculated `eig()` and `eigh()` to understand coordinate transformations.
    * **Determinants & Inverses:** Detailed usage of `np.linalg.det()` and `np.linalg.inv()` with error handling for singular matrices.
- **Tensor Operations:** Practiced multi-dimensional array operations and contractions.
- **Documentation:** Every function was documented in a `.ipynb` with a breakdown of all parameters, possible values, and practical examples.
